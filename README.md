# Project Product Demand Prediction
## Overview
### in this project we have a store dataset in Our task is how to choose the right 
### price for a product during a discount in order to optimize losses when selling 
### and predict the ideal price of the product
## And for this I used  
###   Decision tree Linear regression
## Files
+   CSV - this is the dataset file
+   Product Demand Prediction.ipynb - this is the file where the code. is written
+   README.md: This  file providing an overview of the project.
+   Requirements - this is Requirements of libraries

##  Application and adjustments

+ Clone this repository
+ Ensure you have the required dataset MSFT.csv in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
+ Open  Product Demand Prediction.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
+ Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, visualize it, and build  predictive models.
+ Explore the results and experiment with different algorithms and parameters as needed.
## About the Project
### This project can be divided into 5 main parts

+ Reading and processing data
+ Reading and processing data removing unnecessary parts and errors
+ Information visualization
+ Mdel creation and Training set
+ Model testing and Verification

## note
+ in Windows it is used to indicate the file path two \\ and Mac Linux one \
